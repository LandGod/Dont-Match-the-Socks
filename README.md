## About the Game

The tongue-in-cheek idea behind this game is that if you are someone who wears pattered socks, you certainly wouldn't want to ever wear a matching pair (unless you're a psychopath). But let's take things a step further. Lets try to have 14 unique socks, 2 for each day of the week, never once wearing a single sock more than once.

#### F.A.Q.

**Q**: Isn't this just a regular matching game? 
**A**: Well... yeah.

**Q**: I match my socks and I resent the implication that I am a psychopath!
**A**: That's not a question.


## Behind the Game

### Technology

Don't Match the Socks was created using ReactJS. Bootstrap was used for styling along with the React-Bootstrap package. Pagination is handled using the React-Router-Dom package. 

### User Stories
