# Working Title: Don't Match the Socks

## About the Game

As the the development of this game is only beginning to be developed at the time of this writing, all of this is subject to change. That said, the basic idea for the game is that if you are someone who wears pattered socks, you certainly wouldn't want to ever wear a matching pair (unless you're a psychopath). But let's take things a step further. Lets try to have 14 unique socks, 2 for each day of the week, never once wearing a single sock more than once.

### User Stories

* As a user I can try to pick a unique sock from a grid of 14 unique socks.
* As a user I can keep track of my streak of correctly un-matched socks, up to 14.
* As as user I will see my socks rearranged after each selection, such that there is a challenge in keeping track of which socks I have already selected. 
* As a user I can keep track of the number of times I have gotten a perfect score.
* As a user I can keep track of my highest perfect score *streak*.

### Alternate Titles

* Don't be a psychopath 
* Socks to be you
* Socks to sock

## Information about the React Implementation in this Project:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
